## General Networking

| Term     | Description                                                                                  |

| **Switch**       | A network device that connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data. |
| **Firewall**     | A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.        |
| **IP Address**   | A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.                        |
| **MAC Address**  | A hardware address that uniquely identifies a network interface card (NIC).                |
| **Subnet**       | A segmented piece of a larger network, defined by its subnet mask.                         |
| **Gateway**      | A network node that serves as an access point to another network.                          |
| **MTU**          | Maximum Transmission Unit — the largest size of a packet that can be sent in a single transmission. |

## Protocols & Concepts

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **UDP**          | User Datagram Protocol — connectionless, faster but less reliable than TCP.                  |
| **BGP**          | Border Gateway Protocol — routing protocol used to exchange routing info between autonomous systems. |
| **OSPF**         | Open Shortest Path First — link-state routing protocol used within an autonomous system.     |
| **NAT**          | Network Address Translation — translates private IP addresses to public and vice versa.     |
| **DNS**          | Domain Name System — translates domain names to IP addresses.                               |
| **DHCP**         | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol — assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices.          |
| **VLAN**         | Virtual LAN — logically segments networks for better performance and security.              |
| **QoS**          | Quality of Service — manages traffic to reduce latency, jitter, and packet loss.            |
| **ACL**          | Access Control List — rules that permit or deny traffic on a router or switch.              |

## Network Operations & DevOps

| Term              | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Provisioning**      | The process of setting up network devices and assigning configurations.                     |
| **Configuration Backup** | A saved copy of a router’s configuration to restore settings if needed.                |
| **Firmware**           | Software embedded in a router or switch that controls its operation.                     |
| **Monitoring**         | Observing network health and performance using tools like SNMP, NetFlow, or syslog.     |
| **SNMP**               | Simple Network Management Protocol — used for collecting and organizing information from network devices. |
| **Uptime**             | The amount of time a device has been running without interruption.                       |
| **CLI**                | Command Line Interface — often used to configure network devices directly.               |
| **Zero-Touch Provisioning** | Automates the configuration of devices without manual intervention.                 |
| **Rollback**           | Reverting a router or switch to a previous configuration or firmware version.            |
| **Remote Access**      | Managing network devices over a remote connection (e.g., SSH, Telnet).                   |

## Troubleshooting & Security

| Term          | Description                                                                                  |
